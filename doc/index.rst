PCMCam - Patch Clamp Microscopy Camera
======================================

Introduction
------------

PCMCam is a program for controlling a microscope camera that was designed specifically for patch-clamp applications.
Features include:

* Dark-field correction for CCD cameras
* Single keystroke capture to internal palette and disk ("C" key)
* Rapid swapping of live screen and stills ("S" key)
* Two independent exposure settings intended to be associated with bright-field/NIR and fluorescence respectively.
* Time-lapse recording

Getting Started
---------------

Follow the steps in to install the software that PCMCam depends on.  When PCMCam is fully setup, you will have an
icon on the desktop to launch the application (actually launch python to start executing the PCMCam code).  Double click
that icon and the program will launch and you should see camera images displayed in the main window.
